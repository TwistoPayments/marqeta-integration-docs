# Card replacement

This process is defined by 3 steps

1. Deactivate all active cards (cards which are activated but not cancelled, any locks are not affected)
2. When all cards are deactivated then is enabled editing `Marqeta order` to change address, nickname, etc.
3. If `Marqeta order` looks correct then `Marqeta card` admin provides buttons to create new cards (yellow or black) via standard admin actions.
